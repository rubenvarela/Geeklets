Geeklets
========

A collection of simple geeklets to be used with GeekTool for cool, customizable information on your desktop.

To add one of these scripts as a geeklet copy the contents of one of the files and paste it into a new geeklet
window with type 'shell'.  Eventually I will be packaging these as geeklet downloadables which will auto-install.
